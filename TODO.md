# TODO - Future Enhancements

## Big Features (v0.5.0+)

### Custom Agent Creation
**Status:** Documented, not planned for immediate implementation
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** High (2-3 weeks)

Full custom agent support with system prompts, templates, and validation.
See `docs/CUSTOM-AGENTS.md` for complete specification.

### LMstudio Model Support
**Status:** Blocked - requires OpenCode plugin investigation
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium

**Issue**: LMstudio plugin initializes but models don't appear in `opencode models` output

**Details**:
- LMstudio is running with models loaded (confirmed via http://localhost:1234/v1/models)
- Plugin shows `[opencode-lmstudio] LM Studio plugin initialized` 
- However, no lmstudio-prefixed models appear in the model list

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Investigate if opencode-lmstudio plugin needs additional configuration
2. Check if there's a different command to query plugin-provided models
3. Add manual LMstudio model support (allow users to manually add models)
4. Work with OpenCode team to fix plugin integration

### TUI Framework Upgrade
**Status:** Obsolete - web UI replaced the legacy readline TUI
**Decision:** Not needed; tool scope is narrow and workflow-focused
